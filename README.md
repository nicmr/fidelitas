# Fidelitas

a modern network music player 


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nicmr/fidelitas.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nicmr/fidelitas)

## Features

WIP


## Requirements

Fidelitas requires [libVLC](https://wiki.videolan.org/LibVLC) to compile and run.

## Building

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/nicmr/fidelitas
cargo build --release
```


## Binary Releases

I'm providing stable precompiled binary releases via github releases.
Find the newest release [here](https://github.com/nicmr/fidelitas/releases).

Currently provided binaries:
 - x64-linux
 - armv7-linux (crosscompiling on travis CI remains broken for the moment.)

For other platforms, you will need to compile the source code manually.
